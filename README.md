# reinforcement_learning
This repository demonstrates a learning approach to the stabilization of a pendulum. Reinforcement Learning is used to learn a policy for balancing a pendulum in the upright position. Reinforcement Learning  hereby refers to Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP), a sampling based version of Dynamic Programming.

# Requirements
- [x] MATLAB 2019a

# Demonstration 
test.m runs the Q-learning algorithm for the stabilization of a pendulum in the upright position.
The resulting policy is shown below.
